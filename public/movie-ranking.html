<H1>Best Movies According to Rosemary</H1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>
        <h3>The Arrival</h3>
            <p>This is an amazing movie that deals with a character's decision to go down a path that she already knows will hurt her, just because it also meant so much to her.</p>
        <h3>Mr. Nobody</h3>
            <p>The movie follows a man down multiple choices he's made in life. In the end, it didn't matter what he chose because everything turned out okay each way.</p>
        <h3>Buried</h3>
            <p>This movie is one of the best, if not the best, movie that Ryan Reynolds has ever made because it gives him so much opportunity to act through a wide range of emotions with very little tools.</p>
