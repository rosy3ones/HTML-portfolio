<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Rosemary and I'm embarking on a journey back to one of the great loves of my life: coding.</p>

<p>I've spent the last twenty years handing the reigns of my life over to people that I thought would or could have my best interest at heart, but doing so only left me with sad stories and no direction. My goal is to engineer my best life, and I will do that by getting back to basics.</p>
